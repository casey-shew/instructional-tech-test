This project is not an assessment unit. It is a playground for you to run Python, import modules, and execute scripts that have been provided for you.

The two most important features are the **Filetree** and the **Terminal**. The Filetree is like a "My Documents" folder, showing all of the files available to you in this project.  As you can see, there are three folders (`folder1`, `folder2`, `folder3`), each with three files in them.

The Terminal is the command shell that you will use to navigate these folders, and to run Python.
