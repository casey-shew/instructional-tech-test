To run Python interactively, open up a Terminal and type
    
    python

This command will run Python (version 3.6) interactively, meaning that you can type Python commands and it will respond immediately. However, you can no longer change directories or look at files (`cd` or `ls` will not work).

To quit Python and return to the normal Terminal command shell, type
    
    >>> quit()

(do not include the `>>>`; those are provided by Python).
