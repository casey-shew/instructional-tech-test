2. Take the exercise completely as if you are a student
3. Identify and document the following to the best of your ability:
  * What are potential ways a student could get lost or confused in the UI? How could this be improved (on a theoretical level, you don’t need to know the mechanics of how to improve it)?
  * Are there instructions that are unclear or highly likely to confuse students? How could they be improved?
  * Could this activity accidentally get broken by a student accidentally? How?
  * What concerns would you have from a student experience perspective? How could it be improved?
**Points For:**
* Categorizing your feedback clearly by levels of severity and type
* Clarity on where in the UI feedback refers to
* Organizing your feedback so it’s digestible, so that important things are visually prominent and details can be found if needed
**Deliverable**
Feedback report in any form you think will be most effective, this can include any combination of document types, images, or other methods to capture feedback. Can be sent to me through a file attachment or by sharing with me through an application (such as Google Drive or a test case management app). The feedback should be shared with cshew@ecornell.com.
## Part Two: Develop a Training Article from a Video
